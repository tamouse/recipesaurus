Long ago and far away, before the dawn of the web, in fact, I had a little blue notebook that I wrote down recipes I loved. Somewhere along the years, many moves and rearranging, I misplaced it. I was deep into web development by that point, so I opted to gather and recreate what I could from memory into various websites, data collections, personal wikis, and so down the way. The files transformed, but I had the data.

This edition, I'm trying out a newer (as of 2018) technology for static site generation called [Docusaurus].

Plus the good news: my lovely sister eventually found my original little blue notebook as we dug through my storage lockers one fine day.

I have the recipes organized by general categories including:

- Main Dishes
- Side Dishes
- Soups
- Salads
- Desserts
- Baked Goods

and so on.

Since this is a [generated] site, I am hoping I'll also be able to generate a few indexes, based on ingredients, cuisines, ethnicities, and other interesting things. We'll see. :)
