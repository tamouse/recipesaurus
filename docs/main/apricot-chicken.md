This is a quick and easy main dish, something I sort of whipped up on
the spur of the moment.


## Ingredients

* 3 small or 2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cubed
* salt and pepper
* other seasoning as desired (I used Monterey Chicken Spice Blend)
* 1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms, or 1 small can sliced mushroom pieces, drained
* 1/4 cup apricot preserves
* 1/4 cup white wine
* 2 tablespoons tamari sauce
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil


## Directions

1.  Spray a skillet with vegetable oil coating (or use 1 tablespoon olive oil or the like).

1.  If using fresh mushrooms, saut&eacute; them in butter or olive oil until they release their liquid, about 3 minutes. Set aside.

1.  Over medium heat, saut√© the chicken, adding the salt, pepper and spices.

1.  As the chicken nears done, add in the mushrooms, apricot preserves, tamari sauce and sesame oil.

1.  If the sauce is too thin, sprinkle in a **little** flour to thicken it.

Serve over fresh greens or with rice or other grain accompaniment.

Everyone who reads this (and other recipes I use canned mushrooms in)
says "I'd use real mushrooms." Well, yes, you certainly can. I might
too if I remember to buy them and use them. Canned ones mean I don't
have to worry about fresh ones going bad, or going to the store when I
want to make this.

For this recipe, I prefer using a gewurtztramiener for the wine.
