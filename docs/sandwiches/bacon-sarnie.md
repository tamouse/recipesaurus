title: "Bacon Sarnie"
---
I pulled this from a great article in the guardian's Word of Mouth
blog, both as a great recipe, but also as some of the best food
writing around. I've included the whole article below the recipe for
archival reasons.


I should note, what they refer to as the "grill" in the UK, we in the
US typically mean the "broiler". Also, "back bacon" in the US is
usually referred to as "Canadian bacon", while "streaky" or "belly"
bacon is just our everyday bacon.


## Ingredients

### For the rolls (makes 6):

* 450g (2 cups) plain white flour, plus extra for dusting
* 1 teaspoon salt
* ½ teaspoon brown sugar
* 100ml (½ cup) milk, plus extra for glazing
* 200ml (1 cup) water
* 2 teaspoon dried yeast

### The bacon

* 2 rashers dry-cured smoked streaky bacon per person
* 1 rasher dry-cured smoked back bacon per person
* Unsalted butter


## Directions

1. Sift the flour, salt and sugar into a large mixing bowl. Combine the milk and water and heat until tepid, then stir in the yeast. Mix this quickly into the dry ingredients until you have a fairly soft dough, adding a little more milk or water if necessary. Cover and put in a warm place for 1½ hours until well risen.

2. Preheat the oven to 220&degC (425&degF;). Divide the dough into 6 pieces and shape each into an oval (to fit the bacon), then space out on a floured baking tray, cover and leave for 15 minutes.

3. Brush the tops of the rolls with milk, sprinkle with flour, and poke a small indentation in the top of each one. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until pale gold.

4. Heat a griddle pan over a high heat for about 4 minutes, then add the bacon (depending on how many you're catering for, you may need to do this in batches, in which case have the oven on low so you can keep the cooked bacon warm until it's all ready). Cook, without moving, until the fat begins to turn golden, then turn over. Once it's cooked to your satisfaction, move to the edge of the pan.

5. Split each roll in two (the rougher the cut, the crisper the toasted side will be) and toast under the grill on the cut side for about 30 seconds until lightly charred. Butter, stuff with 2 rashers of streaky and 1 rasher of back bacon per person, and serve immediately.
