title: "Famous Carrot Cake"
---
My mom got this recipe out of a newspaper ages and ages ago and it's
been a perennial favourite of our family for a long time, and on to
other families as well. My friend, Marina, made some glorious
modifications to it by adding chopped candied ginger pieces to the
batter. Truly a work of art!

Doing most of the prep work in a food processor makes this an easy
recipe. I remember grating carrots as a kid and getting my hands all
bloody in the process. Still, I did it gratefully and would do
it again if I didn't have a handy food processor.
