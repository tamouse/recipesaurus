title: "Easy Vegetarian Chili"
---
This recipe provides opportunities for a *lot* of variation. The spice
measures are really inexact (instead of "tablespoons", I tend to use
"mound on palm", for example. :) ). The ingredients can be played with
endlessly, even to the point of making minestrone instead of chili. :)
(Just add some macaroni and you're there, practically.)



## Ingredients

* 2 medium onions, peeled and chopped
* 3 to 5 carrots, peeled and chopped (optional)
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced (or 2 tablespoons minced bottled garlic)
* 1 cup chopped celery (optional)
* 1-1/2 cups chopped green bell pepper (optional)
* 1-1/2 cups chopped red bell pepper (optional)
* 1 small can mild roasted green chilies (optional)
* 2 tablespoons ground cumin
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
* 1 large can mushrooms stems and pieces, drained
* 2 large cans diced stewed tomatoes, chili style, with liquid
* 2 cans kidney beans with liquid
* 2 cups frozen, or 1 can kernel corn with liquid
* 2 cups vegetarian broth
* 1 (or 2) bay leaf


## Directions

1.  Heat oil in a large soup kettle or stock pot over medium heat. Saut&eacute; onions, carrots, and garlic until tender.

1. Stir in chopped vegatables, celery, green chilies, and dry spices. Cook until vegetables are tender, about 6 minutes.

1. Open cans and dump into pot. Add enough broth to your taste/desire. Bring to a boil, and reduce heat to medium. Cover, and simmer for *at least* 2 hours, stirring occasionally.

1. Before serving, remove bay leaves!


## Alternatives

* use 1 can each of light and dark red kidney beans.
* use 1 can of black beans and 1 can of great northern beans.
* use 1 can of garbanzo beans and 1 can of another kind of bean.
* using roasted red peppers would be pretty awesome in this.


I modified this a bit to remove the bell peppers for dietary
reasons. Also, the original recipe served 8, I needed to serve 10-12.

I made this in the morning/early afternoon, and it sat until
evening. I think this really made the spices bloom and the flavour was
great. Make well ahead of the meal you're serving this for, then, is
my **strong** suggestion.

Also, one time I made this, I opened a can of cream-style corn by
mistake. It went in quite nicely, just left out a little broth.

This is a fairly mild chili as far as heat goes. You can obviously
make it heat up with habaneros, jalapenos, or chipotles. It might be
interesting to substitute a bottle of salsa for the two cans of
tomatoes. Experiment!
