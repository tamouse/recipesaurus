title: "Pizza Crust"
---
This recipe from my friends Cymru and Alaric is just like the recipe I used to have for pizza crust before I lost my recipe notebook. It's good to see it again!


## Ingredients

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 packet yeast (2¼ tsp)
* ¾ cup hot water
* ¼ cup oil
* 1½ tsp salt
* ½ tsp garlic powder
* 1 tbsp Italian herbs
* ½ tbsp Parmesan cheese
* ¼ tsp black pepper


## Directions

1.  Mix all the dry ingredients together in a bowl.

1.  Add the liquids, stir until it starts to form a ball, scrape off the spoon, and knead in the rest of the flour by hand.

1.  Cover loosely and set aside to rise for 30 minutes.

1.  Roll out or toss to form into a crust.

1.  Top as desired, and bake at your oven's highest temperature for 10 minutes or until the cheese is browned on top.

1.  Allow to rest for 5-10 minutes before cutting.



This makes enough for one large pizza, and the crust should be firm enough to slide into your oven on a pizza peel (no pan required).  For best results, use a preheated pizza stone, or line the bottom of your oven with unglazed terracotta tiles (about $12 a box at your local builders' supply store).




## Variations

Try these variations:

* Use olive oil flavored with basil, garlic, rosemary, or even jalapeño peppers.

* Top your pizza with chopped chicken saut&eacute;ed in Thai Bangkok Padang peanut sauce.

* Saut&eacute; chicken with Italian herbs, simmer in Alfredo sauce, and sprinkle with grated Stilton before baking.

* The Customary Pizza:  Canadian bacon, mushrooms, pineapple, and sliced apple (pepperoni and blue cheese optional).
