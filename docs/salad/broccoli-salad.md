title: "Broccoli Salad"

A great summer salad, awesome for potlucks and barbeques.

This recipe is pretty similar to [Cauliflower Salad], but has a flair
all it's own as well. This has always been a big hit at potlucks and
barbeques, often being specially requested.

## Ingredients

* 1 large bunch of broccoli
* 12 strips of bacon
* 1/2 cup raisins
* 1 cup sunflower seeds
* 1 small red onion
* 1 cup miracle whip
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/3 cup parmesan cheese
* 2 tablespoons white vinegar
* seasoned croutons

## Directions

This is best made in two parts, one part to let the salad get nice and flavourful is made at least 4 hours ahead. The second part is all the ingredients that might get mushy if set in the dressing, is made just before serving.

### Part 1 - made ahead of time

1.  set a huge kettle full of water on the stove to boil

1.  chop up broccoli into small, bite-sized bits *(I tend to use just the flowerettes. I dislike stems)*

1.  when the water is at full boil, blanch the broccoli pieces for 1 minute. drain and plunge into cold water immediately.

1.  peel and thinly slice a red onion, separating all the layers

1.  in a bowl, mix together the dressing ingredients: miracle whip, sugar, parmesan cheese, white vinegar

1.  drain the broccoli and put into a large mixing bowl

1.  add the raisins and sliced red onion

1.  add in the dressing, mixing everything thoroughly together

1.  put salad in the refrigerator for a minimum of 4 hours

### Part 2 - made just before serving

1.  slice up the bacon strips into bits and fry in a medium heat

1.  when the bacon is fully cooked, remove from pan with slotted spoon and set on paper towels to drain and dry

1.  add bacon bits, sunflower seeds, and croutons to salad, mix thoroughly

1.  serve immediately
