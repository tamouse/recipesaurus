title: "Garlic Cheese Biscuits"
---
This is a quick and easy recipe to make biscuits like you'd find at
some nation-wide chain seafood and american food restaurants.


## Ingredients

* 2 1/4 cups biscuit mix (like Bisquick)
* 2/3 cup milk
* handful of shredded sharp cheddar
* a bit of freshly ground pepper
* about a teaspoon of basil
* about a teaspoon of oregano
* a dash or less of chili powder


## Directions

1.  Heat oven to 450&deg;F.

1.  Mix all ingredients in a stainless bowl.

1.  Drop batter onto baking sheet.

1.  Bake at 450&deg;F for 8-10 minutes.

The recipe says it makes 9 biscuits, but these are rather large. I'd suggest making 18 smaller biscuits.
