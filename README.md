# My Recipes Site as a Docusaurus Project

[Docusaurus]: https://docusaurus.io "Docusaurus"
[React]: https://reactjs.org/ "React.JS"


After a presentation by [Jason Hsu]() on his use of [Docusaurus], another tools from Facebook for building documentation static websites, I thought I'd give it a go on my handy recipe site, since it's got a lot of handy entries available.

The [old recipe site](https://github.com/tamouse/recipes) is written using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which has been my tried-and-true static site generator for years. Why change? Because learning new things is great! Also, having a toole that OOB generates great documentation and tutorials is important to me, or will be in the near future, as my work team further develops APIs and Libraries for our product.

[Docusaurus] is written using [React] which I've also been deeply learning and using in my every-day work, and this gives me more chance to practice that.

## Project Closed

As an experiment in learning [Docusaurus], this was pretty successful. As an implementation of a recipe file, not so much, because Docusaurus is really about doing good things for documentation and tutorials, rather than marshalling a huge pile of independent posts.
